/**
 * Two stores, deliberately. `redis` is the multi-tier production default that every hot read
 * path uses — an in-process L1 keeps repeat hits at zero network cost, the L2 in Redis survives
 * restarts and is shared across the api + queue-worker processes, and the bus broadcasts
 * invalidations so each process's L1 evicts the moment a sibling writes. `memory` is the
 * single-tier in-process store the export wizard still calls explicitly via `cache.use("memory")`
 * — its meta-keys snapshot is intentionally per-process (warm restart wins) and doesn't need
 * coherency with other api instances.
 *
 * **`CACHE_DRIVER` is load-bearing**: when it's `memory`, the `redis` store is *not declared* at
 * all (not just not-default). Bentocache's `redisBus` subscribes to its pub/sub channel as soon
 * as the store is constructed, so leaving the definition around in a test/CI boot — where Redis
 * isn't running — exhausts `ioredis`'s retry budget and crashes the process. Dropping the
 * declaration entirely is cheaper and clearer than wiring suppressors around it.
 *
 * **Global defaults** below are tuned for "the catalog stays up if Postgres dies":
 *  - `ttl: "5m"` — fresh data window. Per-call overrides tighten this on hot paths and relax it
 *    on rarely-changing taxonomy.
 *  - `grace: "24h"` — if the factory fails (Postgres outage, network blip) we keep serving the
 *    last good value for a full day. Correctness-sensitive callers (cart pricing, stock,
 *    shipping rates) MUST pass `grace: undefined` per-call to disable this.
 *  - `graceBackoff: "30s"` — after a failed refresh, don't pummel the source; wait 30s before
 *    retrying. Stale data continues to serve in the gap.
 *  - `timeout: "200ms"` (soft) — if the factory takes > 200ms AND a stale value exists in the
 *    grace window, return stale immediately and let the factory finish in the background.
 *  - `hardTimeout: "2s"` — absolute upper bound. The factory keeps running and will populate the
 *    cache for the next request, but this request fails fast.

/**
 * Multi-tier production store. The L1 ceiling is sized so a handful of large paginated catalog
 * responses fit comfortably without crowding the api heap; raise it if `cache:clear`d under load
 * and L1 hit-rate stays low. The bus uses the same `main` Redis connection — `config/redis.ts`
 * already namespaces keys + pub-sub channels by `APP_NAME` so two spins or two replicas don't
 * cross-pollinate.
