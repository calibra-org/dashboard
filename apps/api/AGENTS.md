AdonisJS 7 backend. Source of truth for products, orders, customers, auth, and admin operations. Both the [storefront](../web) and the [admin panel](../admin) talk to it through [`@calibra/sdk`](../../packages/sdk).

## Stack

- **AdonisJS 7** (TypeScript ESM, hot-reload via `hot-hook`, `@poppinss/ts-exec` as the JIT loader).
- **`@adonisjs/bouncer`** — abilities under `app/abilities/main.ts` enforce per-row ownership. Throw via `ctx.bouncer.authorize(ability, resource)` from controllers; the framework's self-handled `E_AUTHORIZATION_FAILURE` turns into a 403. Use a `findOrFail` + `authorize` pair instead of inline `where("user_id", ctx.auth.user!.id)` lookups.
- **`@adonisjs/limiter`** — named limiters in `start/limiter.ts` (auth/login_email/payments/webhooks/admin_writes). Apply per-route via `.use(limiterName)`. The bootstrap clears the memory store between specs so tests don't collide.
- **`@adonisjs/shield`** — security headers (CSP report-only, HSTS, X-Frame DENY, X-Content-Type nosniff). CSRF is disabled — bearer-token API has no cookie surface.
- **`@adonisjs/lock`** — distributed mutex via `lock.createLock(key, ttl).runImmediately(callback)`. Wrap any critical section where two concurrent requests with the same id would corrupt state (import rollback, refund issuance, PSP verify). Returns `[acquired, result]`; treat `acquired=false` as 409.
- **`@adonisjs/core/health`** — `/health/live` + `/health/ready`. The ready probe runs registered checks from `start/health.ts` (DB, Redis, memory, disk) and returns 503 on degraded.
- **`@adonisjs/otel`** — env-gated. `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` enables tracing; pointed at any OTLP collector (Tempo, Jaeger, Grafana Cloud free tier). Error reporting today is Pino structured logs only; a Sentry-protocol receiver like GlitchTip can be wired later if/when needed.
- **Domain events** — `app/events/<event>.ts` subclasses `BaseEvent`. Listeners register in `start/events.ts`. Use events to decouple side effects (audit log writes, broadcasts) from the request flow.
- **Domain exceptions** — `app/exceptions/domain_exceptions.ts` provides `ResourceNotFound` (404), `ResourceConflict` (409), `ResourceGone` (410), `BusinessRule` (422). Each self-handles to the consistent `{ errors: [{ message, code, ...meta }] }` envelope.
- **Request ID** — every response carries `X-Request-Id`; the global exception handler tags Sentry with it. Upstream-provided IDs (load balancer, Cloudflare) are honoured verbatim.
- **Lucid 22** ORM on **PostgreSQL 17**. v22 auto-generates `database/schema.ts` from migrations — models extend the generated `<Entity>Schema` classes (column types come for free, no hand-maintained `@column` boilerplate).
- **VineJS 4** for request validation. Schemas compile once at module scope.
- **`@adonisjs/auth` 10** with the `access_tokens` guard (configured on first wiring — see "Auth" below).
- **`@adonisjs/i18n` 3** wired; the active locale is on `ctx.i18n` (set by the `detect_user_locale_middleware` from the `Accept-Language` header). API `defaultLocale` is `"fa"` — see `config/i18n.ts`.
- **`@adonisjs/cors` 3** + **encryption** (`config/encryption.ts`, chacha20 driver).
- **Japa 5** for unit + functional tests, with **`@japa/api-client` 3** for real-HTTP assertions through the wired router. **Model factories** live under `database/factories/`.
- **AdonisJS Transformers** (first-party in v7 — `https://docs.adonisjs.com/guides/frontend/transformers`) shape every API response. Each resource gets a class extending `BaseTransformer<T>` under `app/transformers/`. Sensitive columns are never picked, so they cannot leak. Controllers stay one-liners: `return serialize(ProductTransformer.transform(products))` (or `.paginate(paginator)` for paginated responses).
- **Pino** structured logging (pretty in dev, ndjson in production).

Local docs cache for the agent doing the work: `~/adonis-v7-docs/content/` (framework) and `~/adonis-lucid-docs/content/docs/` (ORM). Read those before reaching for memory.

## Caching (`@adonisjs/cache` / Bentocache)

The api uses `@adonisjs/cache` (Bentocache under the hood) configured as a **multi-tier store**: in-memory L1 + Redis L2 + Redis bus, defined in `config/cache.ts`. The bus keeps the L1 layer of every process (api + queue worker + future replicas) coherent — when one writes, the others evict.

**Default story** for read endpoints: wrap the heavy fetch in `cache.getOrSet({ key, ttl, grace, tags, factory })`. The factory only runs on a real miss; stampede protection means 10,000 simultaneous misses still produce one query. Set a `grace` window so a brief Postgres / Redis hiccup serves slightly-stale data instead of a 500 — this is a UX feature, not a perf hack.

**The "never cache" list** — these read paths mutate per request or carry correctness consequences if stale:
- Cart contents (per-session mutation surface).
- `inventory_items.stock_status` (oversell risk).
- Order detail/list/history, payment attempts, refunds (legal/financial state).
- Authenticated `/account/*` (per-user, low cache hit rate, high freshness expectation).
- Customer notes, customer timeline (admin operators expect live data).

When in doubt, ask: **"if this is 30 seconds stale, does a user see a wrong price, oversell, or wrong status?"** If yes → don't cache, or cache with `grace: undefined` and a sub-minute TTL.

**Keys + tags** live in `app/services/cache_keys.ts`. Always go through the builders — no inline string templates in controllers. Every key includes the locale segment (`fa` / `en`) because Persian and English responses are different bytes. Filter keys are built from a **sorted, normalized** parameter object so `?a=1&b=2` and `?b=2&a=1` collide.

**Invalidation is the contract.** Every write path must `cache.deleteByTag({ tags: [...] })` for the tags it touches. The mapping lives next to the tag constants in `cache_keys.ts`; wire it through domain events (`app/events/*`) where possible so a refund issued via any controller invalidates correctly. **A new read endpoint without a paired tag and a write-path invalidation is a bug — it ships stale data the moment anything changes.**

**Tests are mandatory.** Every cached endpoint needs a Japa functional test covering: (1) cold-miss populates the cache, (2) warm-hit doesn't re-query, (3) tag invalidation after a write returns fresh data, (4) the cached response still passes `assertAgainstApiSpec()`.

**Tunable defaults** (`config/cache.ts`): `ttl: "5m"`, `grace: "24h"`, `graceBackoff: "30s"`, soft `timeout: "200ms"`, `hardTimeout: "2s"`. Override per call when the data has different freshness needs (taxonomy → `30m`, admin counts → `2m`, shipping → `5m` no grace, single-use values → `pull`).

**Ace ops**: `node ace cache:clear` (whole store), `cache:clear --tags=catalog:products` (targeted), `cache:delete <key>` (surgical), `cache:prune` (n/a for Redis, only DB driver).

**Local docs cache**: `~/adonis-v7-docs/content/guides/digging_deeper/cache.md` (framework integration) and `~/Julien-R44/bentocache/docs/content/docs/` (engine details — grace, stampede, multi-tier, tags, namespaces, adaptive caching). Read these before reaching for memory.

## Local observability & search (per-spin)

Every `pnpm spin <slug>` brings up a full prod-parity infra alongside the app:

- **Caddy** terminates TLS for every service with an internal CA. All UIs reachable at `https://<service>.<slug>.spin.localhost`. Run `caddy trust` once on your machine to trust the local root. Bare ports still work as escape hatches; the hostname route is the prod-parity path.
- **GlitchTip** (Sentry-protocol) — errors thrown via `@sentry/node` show up at `errors.<slug>.spin.localhost`. The DSN is written to `apps/api/.env` as `GLITCHTIP_DSN` once the operator registers + creates an org/project on first run (auto-provisioning is on the roadmap; the handoff card prints the one-time setup blurb). Anything you'd report in prod, report locally too — that's how we catch silent error-handler regressions.
- **Prometheus + Grafana + Loki + Tempo + Alertmanager** — the api exposes `/metrics` (Prometheus text format), tees ndjson logs to `<worktree>/.spin/logs/api.ndjson` (Promtail → Loki), and emits OTLP traces to Tempo (the OTLP/HTTP receiver is published on the `tempo` port; the HTTP API is fronted by Caddy for Grafana datasource access). The starter Grafana dashboard "Calibra api — request overview" loads on first visit. Adding a new dashboard? Commit it to `docker/observability/grafana/dashboards/` — clickops dashboards aren't reproducible.
- **Uptime Kuma** runs an external probe against `/health/ready`. Configure additional probes via the UI; the config is per-spin (lives in the spin's docker volume).
- **Meilisearch** runs on `search.<slug>.spin.localhost`. The api auto-discovers it via `MEILISEARCH_HOST` + `MEILISEARCH_API_KEY` (`config/env.ts`); the singleton client lives in `app/services/meilisearch.ts`. Reindex flows go through the search-index service (lands in a follow-up PR).

**Production parity is the contract.** Production will use the same images (Caddy, Grafana, Prometheus, Loki, Tempo, GlitchTip, Meilisearch) reached via real hostnames behind Cloudflare/Arvan. If a feature behaves differently in your spin than it does on staging, that's a dev-env bug — file it, don't paper over it.

**Stack down**: `pnpm spin stop <slug>` stops everything. `--purge` drops the data volumes (Grafana dashboards you didn't commit, Meilisearch index, Loki history, GlitchTip events). Commit anything you want to keep.

**Direct-port escape hatches** (in addition to the Caddy routes): `localhost:<api>`, `localhost:<redis>`, `localhost:<mailpit-web>`, `localhost:<adminer>`, `localhost:<redisinsight>`, `localhost:<meilisearch>`. Useful for `curl`, `redis-cli`, `psql`, and HMR. Other UIs are intentionally Caddy-only — go through the hostname.

**Sentry/Pino layering** — Pino remains the structured-logging primary; Sentry/GlitchTip captures exceptions and tracks regressions. Don't log AND `Sentry.captureException` for the same event from controllers; the global exception handler already does both. Use `Sentry.captureMessage()` only for non-throw notable events (e.g. a fallback path firing).

## Conventions

- **Subpath imports.** Every internal import goes through the `#namespace/*` aliases declared in `package.json#imports`. Available aliases: `#controllers/*`, `#exceptions/*`, `#models/*`, `#services/*`, `#middleware/*`, `#validators/*`, `#transformers/*`, `#providers/*`, `#database/*`, `#start/*`, `#tests/*`, `#config/*`, `#generated/*`. Never use deep relative paths like `../../models/product`. Ace scaffolds already follow this.
- **Filenames are `snake_case.ts`.** Controllers end with `_controller.ts`, middleware with `_middleware.ts`, models stay singular (`product.ts`), validators with `_validator.ts`, transformers with `_transformer.ts`. Class names stay PascalCase.
- **Models extend the generated schema class.** After `node ace migration:run`, `database/schema.ts` is regenerated with one `<Entity>Schema` per table. The hand-written model just does `class Product extends ProductSchema { /* relationships, hooks, computed */ }`. Don't redeclare columns the schema class already covers.
- **Transformers own response shape.** Never hand-build JSON objects in controllers. Each resource gets `app/transformers/<resource>_transformer.ts` extending `BaseTransformer<T>` with `toObject()` + variant methods (`forList`, `forDetail`, `forAdmin`). Sensitive fields are simply not picked.
- **Versioned routes.** Public endpoints sit under `/api/v1/*`. Liveness probe at `/health` is unversioned. Breaking changes go behind `/api/v2/*` rather than mutating v1. Each domain has its own file under `start/routes/<domain>.ts` imported from `start/routes.ts`.
- **Money in integer minor units.** Every monetary column is `BIGINT` Rial minor units. Convert to a major-unit string only at the JSON response edge (inside the transformer).
- **Validators are VineJS, called inside the controller** until they grow more than a handful of lines — then extract into `app/validators/<resource>_validator.ts` and import.
- **Every new list / paginated endpoint goes through the TableView primitive** (`#lib/table_view`). Declare a view under `app/table_views/<scope>/<resource>.ts` with the filterable / orderable columns + `defaultSort`, wrap `view.schema` in your validator (spread `view.schema.getProperties()` and add any endpoint extras like `q` / `tab` / `trashed`), then call `view.run(prebuiltBuilder, parsed)` from the controller. The shared wire grammar (`filter[]=field:op:value`, `filterOr[]=…`, `sort[]=field:dir`, `page`, `limit`) is uniform across resources. Full guide + worked examples + migration status in [`app/lib/table_view/README.md`](app/lib/table_view/README.md).
- **Migrations are immutable once shipped.** Use a new migration to alter an existing table, never edit history. Seeders must be idempotent (`updateOrCreate`, not `create`).
- **Pagination response envelope:** `{ data: T[], meta: { page, perPage, total, lastPage } }` — produced by `Transformer.paginate(paginator)`. The SDK's `Paginated<T>` matches this exactly; keep them in sync.
- **Every new endpoint ships with a Japa functional test.** Mandatory, no exceptions. Live under `tests/functional/<domain>/<resource>.spec.ts` (mirror the controller layout — e.g. `app/controllers/admin/reports_controller.ts` → `tests/functional/admin/reports.spec.ts`). Cover at minimum: the unauthenticated 401, an unauthorized 403 (if the route is admin-only or otherwise gated), the happy-path 200 with `response.assertAgainstApiSpec()` (this is what enforces the schema is real), and each meaningful query/filter dimension as its own test. Don't open a PR with a new endpoint and "I tested manually with curl" — the spec assertion *is* the contract and CI runs it.
- **Response shapes are named components, never inlined.** Anything that returns a domain object (product row, report row, range window, …) gets a schema file at `docs/api/reference/openapi/common/components/schemas/<Entity>.yaml` and is `$ref`'d from the path file. Inlined `properties: { ... }` blocks in path files are a code smell — they hide the entity, prevent reuse, bloat the bundle, and produce anonymous types in the generated SDK. The litmus test: if the same shape might appear in a sibling endpoint *ever*, extract now. Examples already in `common/components/schemas/`: `Money`, `PaginationMeta`, `Address`, `Region`, `Translation`, `BasicMessage`, `ValidationErrorMessage`, `TopProduct`, `ReportRange`.

## Multi-tenancy (bridge model)

One shared Postgres holds every tenant. Each per-tenant row carries `tenant_id BIGINT NOT NULL` and is guarded by `ENABLE` + `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` with a `tenant_isolation` policy keyed off the `app.current_tenant` GUC. A future whale tenant is promoted to its own database by setting `tenants.connection_name` — `resolveTenantConnection()` (`config/database.ts`) is the seam.

- **Two Postgres roles** (`node ace db:bootstrap-roles`, once, as superuser): `calibra_app` (NOBYPASSRLS) is the runtime role on the default `postgres` connection — RLS is *always* enforced for it, so a query with no GUC set returns **zero rows** (fail-closed). `calibra_admin` (BYPASSRLS) is the `postgres_admin` connection — migrations, seeders, and the queue worker run here to read/write across tenants. Env: `DB_USER`/`DB_PASSWORD` (app), `DB_ADMIN_USER`/`DB_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (admin), `DB_SUPERUSER_*` (bootstrap only).
- **Run migrations + seeders on `postgres_admin`**: `node ace migration:run --connection=postgres_admin`, `node ace db:seed --connection=postgres_admin`. `just migrate` / `just seed` already do this (and bootstrap roles first).
- **Per-request context**: `tenant_context_middleware` (server-level, before metrics) resolves the tenant from the `X-Calibra-Tenant` header (id or slug, set by the web/admin BFFs) → falling back to `Host` → `tenant_domains`. It opens a transaction, sets `app.current_tenant` via `set_config(..., true)` (≡ `SET LOCAL`, PgBouncer-safe), and runs the request inside `runWithTenant` (`#services/tenant_context`). Platform (`/api/v1/platform/*`) and infra (`/health*`, `/metrics`) routes skip resolution. A tenant indicated-but-missing → 404; suspended/archived → 503; no tenant indicated → request proceeds unscoped (and sees zero per-tenant rows under `calibra_app`).
- **Tenant-scoped models** are bound automatically by the `start/tenant_scope` preload (it stamps `tenant_id` on insert and wraps `query()` to ride the request transaction for every model with a `tenantId` column) — only `User` + `OtpCode` additionally compose the `TenantScoped` mixin. Tenant-scoped controllers + services **never** import `db` directly for tenant tables — use the model, `currentTrx()`, or `withTenantTransaction()`. A bare `db.from("…")`/`db.rawQuery("…")` on a per-tenant table runs on a pool connection with no GUC and returns **zero rows under `calibra_app`** (fail-closed) in production even though the superuser test suite is green; treat any such site as a prod bug. **Global / platform / control-plane reads use `db.connection("postgres_admin")` explicitly** (auth user-create, platform, `tenant_provisioning_service`, `tenant_resolver`).
- **Caching is fully tenant-namespaced.** Every `CacheKeys.*` / `CacheTags.*` builder takes a **required leading `tenantId`** and prefixes the key/tag with `tenantSegment(tenantId)` (`#services/cache_keys`) — two tenants can never share a cache slot (a cross-tenant hit is a data leak, not staleness). Read paths pass `currentTenantId()`; write-path invalidation (`#services/cache_invalidation`) takes the acting tenant id (from `currentTenantId()` or `order.tenantId`). The only un-namespaced keys/tags are the control-plane tenant-resolution ones (`CacheKeys.tenant.*`, `CacheTags.tenants`), which run before tenant context is established.
- **Media storage is per-tenant**: `media.tenant_id` + FORCE RLS (migration `1750002000000`), files land under `storage/uploads/t{tenantId}/…` (`#services/media_storage`), and the public `/uploads/*` route stays unauthenticated because isolation is physical (the `t{id}/` URL segment is the namespace). `media:regenerate-variants` runs per-tenant.
- **Background jobs run with no request context.** Export/import jobs wrap the runner in `withJobTenantContext` (`#jobs/with_job_tenant_context`): discover the owning row's `tenant_id` on `postgres_admin`, then run the body on the `calibra_app` connection with the GUC set (RLS-scoped). Cross-tenant CLI commands (`cart:purge`, `payments:reconcile`, `media:regenerate-variants`) loop tenants via `forEachTenant` (`#services/tenant_runner`). Both ride the caller's context when one already exists (inline sync-driver dispatch).
- **Numbering**: per-tenant order/refund numbers come from `nextNumber("order"|"refund")` (`#services/tenant_numbering_service`) — a `tenant_number_counters` row incremented under the request-txn row lock; numbers restart at 1000 per tenant.
- **Provisioning**: `TenantProvisioningService` / `node ace tenant:create <slug>` create a tenant + subdomain + defaults (tax/shipping/settings/gateway) + owner admin. Defaults include an `sms` settings group (`from_number` / `from_name`, empty → fall back to `SMS_FROM`); OTP send resolves the per-tenant sender via `resolveSmsFrom()` (`#services/sms/sms_sender`). Currency resolves per-tenant too — `resolveCurrencyConfig` reads the General `currency` setting then the tenant row's `currency_code`.
- **Auth**: shoppers + shop staff live in tenant-scoped `users` (per-tenant email/phone uniqueness); phone/email OTP (`/api/v1/auth/otp/{request,verify}`) + email-password login. Platform operators are global `platform_users` authenticated by the standalone `platformAuth` middleware (`pat_` tokens in `platform_access_tokens`) — kept off `ctx.auth` so the tenant-side user type stays `User`. Impersonation mints a short-lived shop-admin token with an `impersonated_by:<id>` ability, audits to `tenant_impersonation_events`, and is surfaced by `/auth/me` + revoked by `/auth/impersonation/stop`.
- **Request transactions**: `tenant_context_middleware` wraps each tenant request in one transaction carrying the GUC. Controllers/services that need their own transaction use `withTenantTransaction(cb)` (`#services/tenant_context`) — it runs the callback directly on the request transaction so reads/writes/locks stay on one connection (a separate `db.transaction()` can't see the request's uncommitted rows). Reads ride the request transaction too: the `start/tenant_scope` preload wraps every per-tenant model's `query()`. **Caveat**: when a user must be created *and* have an access token minted in the same request, create it on the committed `postgres_admin` connection first (the token provider runs on its own connection) — see `otp_controller` / `register_controller`.
- **Control-plane surface (Phase 5 brought forward)**: the platform endpoints have a full OpenAPI surface (`docs/api/reference/openapi/platform.v1.yaml`) and a generated SDK surface (`@calibra/sdk` `createPlatformClient` / `client.platform`). `check:api-docs` and the test-spec merge cover all three surfaces (storefront / admin / platform).

> Caveat: minting an access token for a user **created in the same request transaction** fails the token table's FK (the provider runs on its own connection and can't see the uncommitted user). Create such users on the admin connection (committed) before minting — see `otp_controller`.

## API spec drift

Two complementary mechanisms keep the hand-authored OpenAPI documentation honest with the code:

- **Runtime contract assertions.** `tests/bootstrap.ts` wires `@japa/openapi-assertions` against `docs/api/dist/_merged.test.json`. Functional tests call `response.assertAgainstApiSpec()` after every successful (2xx) status assertion; schema drift turns a test red. The `pretest` npm script regenerates the merged spec before every `node ace test` run, so the assertions always validate against the latest source.
- **Route inventory lint.** `node ace check:api-docs` diffs the live router against the bundled spec and exits 1 on new drift (`missing-in-spec` / `stale-in-spec` / `mismatch`). Acknowledged drift from before the lint was wired up lives in `.check-api-docs-known-drift.json`; remove entries when the route or spec catches up, regenerate with `--update-known-drift` after intentional changes.

## Auth (when wiring)

`@adonisjs/auth@10` is installed but not yet wired. When wiring:

1. `node ace configure @adonisjs/auth --guard=access_tokens` — wires the auth provider, generates the `auth_access_tokens` migration, scaffolds `app/middleware/auth_middleware.ts`.
2. Add a `User` model + `users` migration; reference it from `config/auth.ts` as the user provider.
3. Mount login routes (`POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`) under `start/routes/auth.ts`. Register the `auth` middleware in `start/kernel.ts` `router.named({ auth: () => import('#middleware/auth_middleware') })`.
4. Mint tokens with `User.accessTokens.create(user, abilities?, { expiresIn })`; ship `tokenResult.value!.release()` to the client.
5. In tests, use `.loginAs(user)` from `@japa/api-client` — it mints a real token and attaches the bearer header through the full pipeline.
