/**
 * Analytics aggregation service — the single source of truth for the sales math behind every
 * `/api/v1/admin/reports/*` endpoint. Centralising the formulas here is the load-bearing
 * guarantee that the Overview tiles, the Revenue table, and the Orders chart can never disagree
 * about what "net sales" means.
 *
 * **Counted statuses.** Only orders the merchant actually billed contribute to sales figures:
 * `processing`, `completed`, and `refunded`. A refunded order still represents a sale that
 * happened — the money that came back is surfaced separately as `returns`, never by dropping the
 * order. Drafts, pending, on-hold, cancelled, and failed orders never count.
 *
 * **Sales definitions** (Rial minor units, integer end-to-end):
 * - `gross_sales`  = Σ line_item.subtotal              (price × qty, pre-coupon, pre-tax, pre-refund)
 * - `coupons`      = Σ order.discount_total            (coupon discount on goods)
 * - `returns`      = Σ refund.amount_minor             (bucketed by refund.processed_at, not order date)
 * - `taxes`        = Σ order.tax_total − Σ refund.tax_amount_minor
 * - `shipping`     = Σ order.shipping_total
 * - `total_sales`  = Σ order.grand_total − returns     (all-in revenue net of refunds)
 * - `net_sales`    = total_sales − taxes − shipping    (goods revenue; excludes tax + shipping)
 *
 * Sales metrics bucket by `orders.created_at`; refunds bucket by `order_refunds.processed_at`, so
 * a May refund of an April order lands in May's returns. This matches WooCommerce's revenue model.
