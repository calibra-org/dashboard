 *  - `calibra_admin` (LOGIN, **BYPASSRLS**, CREATE on schema) — owns the schema; migrations,
 *    seeders, and the queue worker connect as this role so they read/write across every tenant.
 *  - `calibra_app` (LOGIN, NOSUPERUSER, **NOBYPASSRLS**) — the runtime app role. RLS is always
 *    enforced for it; default privileges grant it DML on every table `calibra_admin` creates.
 *
 * Re-running is a no-op beyond re-asserting attributes, passwords, and grants. Identifiers are fixed
 * constants; only the passwords are interpolated, single-quote-escaped (Postgres `PASSWORD` requires
 * a string literal and cannot be a bind parameter).
