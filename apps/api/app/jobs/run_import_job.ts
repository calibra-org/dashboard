/**
 * Thin shell around {@link runImport} so the importer can run on a background worker. Keeps
 * the business logic in one place; this class only handles serialisation + queue plumbing.
 *
 * Retries are off (`maxRetries: 0`): a partial run leaves an inconsistent counter snapshot on
 * the `product_imports` row that the operator already sees in the wizard, so a silent retry
 * would double-count without giving any feedback. The operator triggers a fresh run instead.
 *
 * Wall-clock duration + completion outcome land in the queue metrics so the cache-and-queue
 * dashboard can show throughput + failure-ratio per queue without grovelling through the DB.
