/**
 * Gatekeeper for admin-only routes. Always mounted after `auth`, so `ctx.auth.user` is guaranteed
 * to be resolved; this middleware decides two things: the role check, and (defense in depth on top
 * of RLS) that the authenticated user belongs to the tenant the request was scoped to.
 *
 * Non-admin callers get a localized 403 — never a 401 — so the caller knows the token is valid but
 * insufficient. A token whose user belongs to a *different* tenant than the one resolved from
 * `X-Calibra-Tenant` / `Host` (`tenant_context_middleware`) is rejected with `E_TENANT_MISMATCH`:
 * RLS already scopes every row read to `app.current_tenant`, so such a session would see an empty
 * shop — but failing loud here stops a staff member from poking another shop's admin by swapping the
 * host, and surfaces the mismatch to the BFF so it can force a re-login (Phase 4 RULE B).
