/**
 * Class-name orchestration for the {@link DayGrid}, extracted out of the component so the
 * conditional Tailwind strings sit in one auditable place. The day grid renders a lot of
 * overlapping modifier states (today, selected, range_start, range_end, range_middle,
 * previewRange, anchor, outside, disabled) and the classes need to compose in a deterministic
 * way — any time two modifiers fire on the same cell, the visible outcome must be the one the
 * design calls for, not whichever Tailwind happened to emit later in the stylesheet.
 *
 * Design choices:
 *
 * 1. **Background lives on the `<td>`, not on a `::before` pseudo.** The pseudo-element approach
 *    worked for half-cell range caps but broke when other modifiers (today border,
 *    previewRange) layered on top — z-index ordering between content, ::before, and the inner
 *    button was finicky and the day numbers occasionally disappeared in preview mode. The cell
 *    background is simpler, has predictable stacking, and inherits text colour correctly.
 *
 * 2. **`rounded-s-full` / `rounded-e-full` on the cell itself** gives the pill caps. A 36×36
 *    cell with radius `9999px` clamps to `min(W/2, H/2) = 18`, so the two start-side corners
 *    meet at the cell-edge midpoint and form a clean semicircle. Range-start cells curve on
 *    their start (LTR=left, RTL=right) side; range-end on the opposite side; range_middle
 *    stays square so adjacent cells join into one continuous strip.
 *
 * 3. **Today's border is suppressed on every selected state** — `border-transparent` on
 *    selected/range_start/range_end/range_middle/anchor cells so the outline doesn't outline
 *    the inner day number when the cell already paints a band.
 *
 * 4. **Text colour is whatever paints the day-number legibly on the cell's current background.**
 *    `text-foreground` (light) on the dark default cell bg; `text-primary-foreground` (dark)
 *    once the cell paints `bg-primary`. The day_button itself has no text-color class so it
 *    inherits from the cell.
 *
 * 5. **`previewRange` uses a translucent band (`bg-primary/30`)** so the hover trail reads as a
 *    "ghost" of the eventual range, distinct from the committed band.
